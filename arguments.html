        <h2>Our Arguments</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>
           <b>Community:</b> Some students find large dorms overwhelming and impersonal; small, intimate satellites foster tight-knit communities where everyone knows everyone.</p>
<p><b>Character:</b> With communities as eclectic as our architecture, satellite dorms are unapologetically weird. We punch above our weight in Scav and intramurals, and establish Tocquevillian institutions of civil society like book clubs and lecture series.</p>
<p><b>Home:</b> Comfortable, intimate public spaces make satellites feel more like homes than dorms. Our lounges aren't just lounges—they're living rooms (and dining rooms, and libraries, and ballrooms, and salons, and concert halls, and war rooms). </p>
<h2>Our Responses to the University's Arguments</h2>
     <p></p>
        <p>The University Says: Centralized dorms promote a strong and unified undergraduate culture that integrates social life and the life of the mind.
<br><i>We Believe: Many students benefit from UChicago's diverse student culture; the university's vision is monolithic.</i></p>

<p>The Resident Master model helps make UC undergrad life special—and it only works in large dorms.<br><i>
Multiple buildings in dorm complexes like Max Palevsky share RMs, and satellites could share RMs with neighbors.</i></p>

<p>Students deserve housing parity: it's not fair for some to live in old dorms far from campus while others have new, conveniently located housing.<br><i>
Satellites like Breck and Maclean—and other old dorms like Snell-Hitchcock and Burton-Judson—are actually in high demand among students.</i></p>

<p>Beautiful new dorms with apartment options will make students want to stay in housing for all four years, making for a more unified undergraduate community in the long term.<br><i>
Beautiful dorms with apartment options (e.g. South Campus) haven't increased retention so far. The real issue is the cost of housing and of mandatory meal plans. Building Campus North does nothing to address these problems.</i></p>

<p>House culture is about more than just names or buildings. Scav and other traditions will survive just fine in Campus North.<br><i>
    Our small, unique buildings help to make us what we are, by giving us Scav space, giant lounges, unique architecture, and a sense of place to anchor our group identities. Furthermore, the current House names tie our communities to decades-old histories and cultures, as well as distinguished alumni and faculty who continue to inspire us.</i></p>
