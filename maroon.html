        <h2>A Response to the Chicago Maroon</h2>
        <p>Malloy Owen</p> 
        <p></p>
        <p>The Maroon editorial board’s article of 24 April, <a href="http://chicagomaroon.com/2015/04/24/home-is-where-the-heart-is-2/" target="_blank">“Home is where the heart is,”</a> did an excellent job of summarizing the arguments that I and other residents of the nine satellite houses heard from College Housing representatives last week. We did not find those arguments convincing then, and we do not find them convincing now that they bear the stamp of our classmates’ approval. </p>
<p>At the heart of the Maroon’s argument is the frequently repeated claim that students really don’t want to live in satellites. To the housing representatives who were forced this week to confront lounges packed with hostile, tearful residents, friends, and even alumni, some of whom came back to Hyde Park to defend their houses on less than six hours’ notice, it’s probably obvious by now that this is simply not true. Yet the Maroon asserts that “in fall 2016, first-years moving into Campus North will be happy with new, updated facilities and probably will not wish that they could live in a dilapidated building a mile away from campus instead.”</p>
<p>I admit that on the surface, the appeal of satellite dorms is hard to understand. Our facilities are old, although “dilapidated” is an exaggeration, and the walk to campus can be inconvenient. Moreover, the satellites aren’t part of some coherent plan to provide “quirky” housing alternatives to students who don’t want to live in large dorms; rather, they’re an accident of the university’s haphazard mid-20th century policy of buying up old buildings in the neighborhood rather than spending the money required to build new ones. It’s easy to understand why someone with a long-term vision for the College like Dean Boyer would think of satellite dorms as nothing more than an obstacle to the kind of university we desire to become. But those of us who live in satellites are convinced that the university stumbled upon something worth preserving during those years of financial instability and inattention to undergraduate life. </p>
<p>The Maroon concludes by suggesting, with a bit of sentimental flair, that house communities are defined by residents rather than physical spaces. If I believed this, I wouldn’t be protesting the move to Campus North, except perhaps to argue that house names honoring important alumni like Sophonisba Breckinridge and Norman Maclean should be preserved. But in reality the Maroon’s optimism doesn’t match the facts. Many of the satellite dorms have unique physical features—like large lounges, rooms with rich histories, large kitchens, side yards, and, yes, distance from campus—that help build community, but the most convincing evidence that satellite communities can’t be reproduced in large complexes is the fact that our residents overwhelmingly identify more strongly with their houses than do residents of larger dorms. (Not everyone wants this, but for some of us it’s perfect.) It’s not obvious to outsiders why this claim should be true, but I doubt that anyone who has paid attention to college housing will try to dispute it. Because incoming students choose buildings rather than houses, the satellite dorms have self-selected student populations who want to be involved in house culture. That won’t be possible in North.</p>

It’s not obvious to outsiders why this claim should be true, but I doubt that anyone who has paid attention to college housing will try to dispute it. Because incoming students choose buildings rather than houses, the satellite dorms have self-selected student populations who want to be involved with their houses. That won’t be the case in North. Even if college housing ends up giving students the option to select houses rather than buildings, how much will group identities built around specific physical spaces matter ten years after those spaces have disappeared?</p>-->
<p>Large dorms are the best housing option for many and perhaps most students in the College. But for other students, like me, a dorm with a strong group identity like Breckinridge or Maclean is a godsend. And all the evidence suggests that these identities emerge organically in satellite dorms, while they have to be handed down from above in larger dorm complexes. The housing office should work to preserve the satellite option for UChicago undergrads.
