        <h2>In Defense of Small Dorms; or, Why Homogeneity Is the Death of Inquiry</h2>
        <p>Jason Quino McCreery AB '14</p> 
        <p>20 April 2015</p>
        <p>In my four years at the University of Chicago, the single most-repeated phrase I heard was, “inquiry-based learning.”  We are an institution that learns not by professors giving answers and students writing said answers down, but by exploring and engaging our minds.  At our best, we critically analyze our education in various fields and disciplines, moving past the textbook and allowing ourselves to learn in our classes, in our RSOs, in our jobs, and in our communities.  Because I think this issue of housing is, at its very heart, an issue of diversity.  We can all agree that the Housing system helps build this fundamental portion of our education—we are placed with students of unlike minds, different backgrounds, and that same thirst and drive for discovery.  But with the closure of small dorms, we lose one of the most important requirements for an inquiry-based education: diversity.
<p>	Diversity is what allows us to inquire in a meaningful way.  The greatest strength of institutions like the University of Chicago is that it is able to pull students and faculty from all corners of the globe into a single geographically-limited space.  When at UChicago, I met other students and professors with such amazing experiences, unlike anyone I knew from high school.  But without diversity, inquiry loses its flavor and value.  An inquiry-based education implies that we will learn from each other and grow from the experience of exploring something together.  Without diversity, inquiry becomes baseless and absurd.</p>
<p>	And I believe, at the end of the day, the great diversity of the College comes from the Housing system.  The Houses break up the imposing monolith of the stereotypical college dorm and allow students a more manageable space to learn and grow.  But at the same time, the different Houses each hold their own culture, and give students the opportunity to experience something new.  The value of the Houses is not that they are smaller than dorms from other schools.  The value is that each House is different from the other Houses.  Meeting someone from Max P or South was different than meeting someone from Maclean or Breckinridge.  Diversity does not simply come from our backgrounds.  Diversity comes from the fact that every day we live different lives, and our living spaces help shape and influence our world views.</p>
<p>	With the loss of the small, independent Houses, the university loses more than several old and decrepit buildings (which, I’ll admit, they are).  We lose distinct perspectives that can only come from being shaped in those small Houses.  Education is dynamic—the person I was when I first walked through Hull Gate changed drastically into the person I was when I stood on the platform on the Quad.  For me, and I know for countless others, that change was (in no small part) able to happen through my House.  The variety of different Houses, big and small, sporty and nerdy, close and far, all help the College (and University as a whole) grow into a truly diverse community.</p>
<p>	This is not an issue that can be resolved by trying to preserve distinct House cultures as they move from their own dorms into Campus North.  Even if the Houses were transplanted into the new space, they would change dramatically.  Part of the culture of the independent Houses comes from the very fact they are independent.  The organic development of the diverse cultures we see today in the Houses necessitates the different physical spaces they have occupied.  So to lose those small dorms, at the end of the day, is to lose something integral to the larger University of Chicago community.  Diversity requires different experiences, in all aspects of life.  From our class schedules to our favorite RSOs to our living spaces, we must remain fundamentally different from each other.  Parity is important, in that we give students equal opportunities to live in a healthy manner, but we must take the utmost caution that parity does not breed homogeneity.
